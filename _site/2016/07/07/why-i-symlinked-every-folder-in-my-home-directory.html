<h3 id="why-i-dont-have-a-home-folder-partition">Why I don’t have a home folder partition</h3>
<p>You might think that the problem I am solving here can very easily be solved by creating a <code class="highlighter-rouge">home</code> folder partition. It’s dead simple and well documented, what can go wrong?</p>

<p>Well, my personal preference is to keep my installation on my laptop as long as possible. From the time 14.04 was released until close to the time 16.04 was released I worked every day on the exat same installation of 14.04. So if I am going to reinstall the OS, I have a reason for LEAVING my current installation and putting an end to the relationship. If I had a <code class="highlighter-rouge">/home</code> partition I would then need to decide which things are settings I want to throw away, which hidden config files might be a part of my reason for leaving. Or I need to format it, which totally defeats the purpose of having it. So when I reinstall I NUKE!</p>

<h3 id="i-didnt-want-to-move-my-stuff-around-anymore">I didn’t want to move my stuff around anymore</h3>
<p>I love the comfort and freedom that comes from getting to set up my entire development environment with a script, it works great and <a href="/2016/04/24/how-i-used-virtualbox-snapshots-to-create-my-ultimate-linux-post-install-script.html">here is how I did it.</a></p>

<p>It lets me completely set up a development environment anywhere in a couple of minutes and my own laptop can have everything installed within an hour after reinstalling the OS.</p>

<p>This past week I benefited from this twice. The first time when I upgraded to Linux Mint 18. The second time when I discovered a weird triple monitor bug that was introduced in Mint 18 so I installed Ubuntu 16.04 which I am now happily using. I am not married to either, for me an operating system needs to be boring, free, have-built-in-window-management-keyboard-shortcuts and let me install everything with scripts. I am much more interested in what I can create with it than what favor of Linux I’m using.</p>

<p>The problem was that every time I need to reinstall I need to move all my stuff, and because I have many tiny files, they go slow even over SATA. Last night I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjHfa5yxlU" target="_blank">watched a talk by Sandy Metz</a> which made me think of my problem as a coupling problem.</p>

<h3 id="my-data-and-my-methods-were-coupled-too-tightly">My data and my methods were coupled too tightly</h3>

<p>If the applications on the computer, acting on the data is like methods or functions, and the data is all the stuff I need to keep and bring to the next installation, I needed a way to decouple this.</p>

<h3 id="heres-what-i-did">Here’s what I did</h3>

<p>The goal with these instructions is to create a separate partition on my SSD where I keep all my ‘homy?’ stuff but the OS does not mout it as <code class="highlighter-rouge">/home</code> it is just mounted as <code class="highlighter-rouge">media/dewet/ssd</code></p>

<p>1) Here are the partitions I created during installation</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>17 gig /swap #I have 16 gigs ram and want the option to hibernate with 10 vm's running if I felt like it
30 gig / #Linux creates all of it's stuff in here, including my home folder
the rest of the ssd /media/dewet/ssd #I could ignore this and do it later by partitioning with disk utility and setting the mount point with `fstab` but the option is in the install gui
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>2) Then after installing I delete every directory in my <code class="highlighter-rouge">home</code> folder except for my Desktop which Ubuntu didn’t allow and I don’t care becasue I don’t usually keep stuff there.</p>

<p>3) Copy all of my backed up Home folder to the root of the partition mounted at <code class="highlighter-rouge">/media/dewet/ssd</code></p>

<p>4) Run this</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>S=(bin code dewetblomerus.github.io Documents Downloads Dropbox Music Pictures Public Templates Videos VirtualBox-VMs);
SSDPATH=/media/dewet/ssd
for i in ${FOLDERS[@]}
do
  rm -f ~/$i
  ln -s $SSDPATH/$i ~/$i
done
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That is an Array and a For loop in bash that creates Symlinks. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">rm</code> deletes the symlinks if they exist which makes the script idempotent and potentially dangerous.</p>
