  <p>Hi, I'm De Wet. My name rhymes with Corvette & sounds like "The Vet".</p>

  <p>People were designed as creative beings. This makes us too valuable to waste our time doing automatable tasks. Let computers handle it so that humans can be freed up to tackle more difficult & creative high level problem solving.</p>

  <p>I derive deep satisfaction from learning exactly what someone is needing to accomplish, and then writing the code to let a computer do it for them. The other thing that I can't seem to ever get enough of, is teaching people to code. I am in awe of the human brain and how with the right attitude, grit & deliberate practice, things that seem impossibly difficult, can become second nature</p>

  <p>I founded <a href="http://togethertech.org/" target="blank">Together Technologies</a> where I work full time. A coding bootcamp with the focus of developing strong rolemodels in underprivileged communities around Cape Town.</p>
