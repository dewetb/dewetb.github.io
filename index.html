  <p>Hi, I'm De Wet. My name rhymes with Corvette & sounds like "The Vet".</p>

  <p>I derive deep satisfaction from learning exactly what someone is needing to accomplish, and then writing the code to let a computer do it for them. Its the problem solving that I enjoy the most.</p>

  <p>The other thing that I can't seem to ever get enough of, is teaching people to code. I am in awe of the human brain and how with the right attitude, grit & deliberate practice, things that seem impossibly difficult, can become second nature. A skill that can then lead someone with minimal formal education out of crushing poverty.</p>

  <p>I founded <a href="http://togethertech.org/" target="blank">Together Technologies</a> where I work full time as the director. We are a coding bootcamp with the focus of developing strong role models in underprivileged communities around Cape Town, South Africa and empowering them in sustainable employment.</p>

  <p>I'm married to my best friend, Marysol, and together we are raising our three young kids, a son and two daughters. I'm an avid cyclist, audio book devourer, and burger connoisseur.</p>
