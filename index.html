      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is De Wet and I am trying to learn some front end skills to complement my back-end skills.

      <div id="main">
        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>My work related goals are to be obedient to the spiritual calling that I am walking out right now & provide as much value as possible to the cause of the ministry project that I am currently working on</p>

        <h3><a href='http://www.togethertech.org'>Together Technologies</a></h3>
        <p>A mentorship program for young men from under privileged areas around Cape Town. We run a Ruby on Rails Bootcamp & mentor these men in all the skills they would need to enter a fruitful career in web development & take good care of their family</p>

        <h3>Langana</h3>
        <p>Langana is a web app that solves 2 different problems for 2 different parts of our society. South Africans with more privilege need help finding trustworthy, hardworking people to hire to do the jobs that can be outsourced, this will free them up to do more revenue producing activities that create even more jobs. Those without privilege needs a way to show that they have a track record of reliable excellent work and that they are hardworking & trustworthy.</p>

        <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>

        <p>What else do I do in my spare time?</p>

        <h3>Keybord snobbery</h3>
        <p>I am currently typing on an Ergodox Programmable Mechanical Keyboard which I soldered together under the instruction of my father who is an old hand with a soldering iron. The keys are completely blank & I customized the layout in the firmware a bit, <a href='https://github.com/dewetb/ergodox-firmware'>here is the repo for the code</a>, so that my most used buttons are within easy reach without ever moving my hands. It's like getting to play a memory game while comfortably & efficiently getting my work done.</p>

        <h3>Cycling</h3>
        <p>When I'm not overwhelmed with really cool meaningful work & 3 small children, I get some exercise by cycling</p>

        <h2 id="fun-facts">Fun Facts</h2>
        <h3>I don't just geek out</h3>
        <p>Random things about myself.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Delivered newspapers when I was in highschool until I could buy a motorcycle</li>
          <li>Finished the windiest Cape Argus Cycle Tour ever</li>
          <li>I once got pulled over for speeding on a snowboard & got my season pass confiscated for the rest of the day when I got caught speeding later the same day</li>
          <li>I have been to 5 continents, and don't feel like traveling far anymore</li>
          <li>I made a door to open with a phone call using Twilio & a Raspberry Pi & an electronic lock. Aside from being a keybaord geek, I love me some power tools & electric circuits.</li>
        </ul>
