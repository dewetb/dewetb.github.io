  <p>My name is De Wet Blomerus (sounds like "The Vet").</p>

  <p>I am a software developer and mentor. I write elegant code while constantly seeking to understand what companies and their clients need, so they can get stuff done without software in the way.</p>

  <p>I have worked in tech roles for the last 6 years and have over 10,000 hours of experience ​solving problems using technology. My passion is to take a tedious but important business process and find ways to innovate and automate with code. It's the problem solving I enjoy the most.</p>

  <p>This is my <a href='blog'>technical blog</a>. It is focused on all things code and sometimes the bigger picture around software.</p>

  <p>I live in Cape Town, South Africa, married to my best friend, Marysol, and together we are raising our three young kids.</p>

  <p>I'm an avid cyclist, audio book devourer, and burger connoisseur.</p>
