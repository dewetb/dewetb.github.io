      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is De Wet and at the time of this writing I am trying to learn how to make my web apps prettier. And how to make images on web pages show up in the size I want them, as opposed to RIDICULOUSLY HUGE!
      </p>

      <div id="main">
        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>My work related goals are to be obedient to the spiritual calling that I am walking out right now & provide as much value as possible to the donors of the ministry project that I am currently working on</p>

        <h3><a href='http://www.togethertech.org'>Together Technologies</a></h3>
        <p>A mentorship program for young men from under privileged areas around Cape Town. We run a Ruby on Rails Bootcamp & mentor these men in all the skills they would need to enter a fruitful career in web development & take good care of their family</p>

        <h3>Langana</h3>
        <p>Langana is a web app that solves 2 different problems for 2 different parts of our society. South Africans with more privilege need help finding trustworthy, hardworking people to hire to do the jobs that can be outsourced, this will free them up to do more revenue producing activities that create even more jobs. Those without privilege needs a way to show that they have a track record of reliable excellent work.</p>

        <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>

        <p>What else do I do in my spare time?</p>

        <h3>Keybord snobbery</h3>
        <p>I am currently typing on a Das Ultimate Clicky keyboard. It has cherry blue switches & is completely blank, so I need to know where all 104 keys are, there is no use in looking down. Just in case there was any dispute about me being a keyboard snob/geek/nerd I just stared assembling an Ergo Dox. I need to solder all the components on the PCB myself to end up with a programmable ergonoic keyboard that comfortably has the #1 spot at the top of the keyboard food chain</p>

        <h3>Cycling</h3>
        <p>When I'm not overwhelmed with really cool meaningful work & 3 small children, I get some exercise by cycling</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Delivered newspapers when I was in highschool until I could buy a motorcycle</li>
          <li>Finished the windiest Cape Argus Cycle Tour ever, & a few more the years after that</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="fun-facts">Fun Facts</h2>
        <h3>I don't just geek out</h3>
        <p>Random things about myself.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I once got pulled over for speeding on a snowboard & almost got my season pass revoked when I got caught speeding later the same day</li>
          <li>I have been to 5 continents, and don't feel like traveling far anymore</li>
          <li>I made a door to open with a phone call using Twilio & a Raspberry Pi & an electronic lock. Aside from being a keybaord geek, I love me some power tools & electric circuits.</li>
        </ul>
