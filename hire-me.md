# Hire me

Running <a href="http://togethertech.org/" target="blank">Together Technologies</a> is my fulltime gig, so everything you see here is part-time only.

If you have a problem that you think can be solved with a web application, scroll to the bottom & send me an email so we can set up a "No Strings Attached" Skype call to chat about it.

# What do you do De Wet?
I find where your employees or customers are wasting their time or getting stuck. Then I build productivity & utility driven web applications that automates the boring stuff, removes the friction & let them focus on what they are trying to get done.

# What tools do you use?
I specialize in Ruby, Rails, Linux, Heroku, HTML and CSS in that order. So if you need a web designer, I should not be your first pick, but I can recommend one.
