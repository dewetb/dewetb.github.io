<p>So this tripped me up today and initial googling was not very helpful, maybe because I did not zero in on the right part of the error soon enough, but I hope you find this helpful.</p>

<p>I created a new Rails app and set up a Postgres database on my development machine. Then as soon as I tried to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">rake db:create</code>, I got the following error</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>could not connect to server: Connection refused
    Is the server running on host "localhost" (127.0.0.1) and accepting
    TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I ended up going down a different route, trying to figure out if the server is running, googling and renaming a pid file, etcâ€¦..</p>

<p>When I finally zeroed in on the port number at the end, I learned that I can check what port Postgres is listening on with <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo -u postgres psql -c "SHOW port;"</code></p>

<p>This showed me that postgres was running on 5433 while Rails was trying to connect to 5432. All I had to do was add a line in my <code class="highlighter-rouge">database.yml</code> to specify the port.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>default: &amp;default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  host: localhost
  port: 5433
  username: postgres
  password: postgres
  pool: 5
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Full disclosure, my username and password is something else, but if you are setting up Postgres in development for the first time, you can get away with these.</p>

<p>Problem solved!</p>
