<div class="gmail_default">If you want to build websites that does unique things (things you can't find a Wordpress Plugin for). And if your main constraint is money (which equials programmer hours), so it has to be done by one person or a small team in a limited amount of time, then it just so happens ​that Rails which is a framework written &amp; built upon with Ruby is the best tool for the job. It can do many other things well, but for this use case I'll argue it is the very best.</div>

<div class="gmail_default">The other places where Ruby really shines are making scripts for text processing &amp; setting up of servers.</div>
