title: My Technology Usage Policy
---

### Why?

I finally became convinced that I will be a happier, more connected, wealthier,
more successful, more devoted version of myself if I only use technology to do
the things I value.

### Social Media

I use WhatsApp for staying in direct communication with people I plan to see in
real life. I keep a LinkedIn account to maintain connections with people I might
want to connect with one day, but I don't log in unless I have a specific person
I want to contact. Every other account has been deleted.

### Movies/TV/Youtube

I only watch one movie per month alone, all other visual entertainment is
consumed with others.

### Audiobooks/Podcasts

I only subscribe to 3 podcasts at a time and only listen to the most compelling
episodes. I do not buy extra Audible credits, one per month through my
subscription is enough.

### Email

I only check email once per day and try to zero all inboxes if possible.

### Sleep

All my devices except for my e-reader automatically cuts off the internet from
21:30 to 6:00 the next morning.

### Browsing

I do not browse the internet for entertainment. I only use the internet when I
have a planned purpose for doing so.

### Phone

WhatsApp is the only social media app on my phone. The browser and YouTube are
both disabled, I only enable it in the settings if I need it for something
specific that can't wait until I am at my computer.
