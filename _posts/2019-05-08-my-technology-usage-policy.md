### Why?

My life was heavily influenced by the following two books

[Why We sleep](https://www.audible.com/pd/Why-We-Sleep-Audiobook/B0752ZQR33){:target="\_blank"}

[Digital Minimalism](https://www.audible.com/pd/Digital-Minimalism-Audiobook/B07LGF8TCJ){:target="\_blank"}

I finally became convinced that I will be a happier, more connected, wealthier,
more successful, more devoted version of myself if I only use technology to do
the things I value.

### Social Media

- I use WhatsApp for staying in direct communication with people I plan to see in real life one day.
- I keep a LinkedIn account to maintain connections with people I might want to connect with one day, but I don't log in unless I have a specific person I want to contact.
- Every other account has been deleted.

### Movies/TV/YouTube

I only watch one movie per month alone, all other visual entertainment is
consumed with others.

### Audiobooks/Podcasts

- I don't just listen to every episode of any podcast, I subscribe to a few and only pick the most compelling ones.

### Email

- I aim to only check personal email once per day and try to zero all inboxes if possible.
- I check work email a couple times per day and try to completely zero the inbox every time.

### Sleep

- All my devices except for my e-reader automatically cuts off the internet from 21:30 to 5:00 the next morning.
- I have Super bright 5000k daylight light bulbs in the office and work facing a window.
- From about 9pm onwards I only use very warm colored amber light bulbs and red night lights to promote melatonin production.

### Browsing

I do not browse the internet for entertainment. I only use the internet when I have a planned purpose for doing so.

### Phone

- WhatsApp is the only social media app on my phone.
- The browser and YouTube are both disabled from 9:30pm until 3pm every week day. I only enable it in the settings if I need it for something specific that can't wait until I am at my computer. (This rarely ever happens)
