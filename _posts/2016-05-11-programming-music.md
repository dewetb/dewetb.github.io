When I turn on music that I would normally listen to, it draws my attention, especially to the lyrics. So generally I want music with no words and I often go for electronic music because after a while it all sounds the same, which allows me to stop focusing on the music and focus 100% on the code.

I subscribe to this rss with a pod catcher on my phone and computer, when I am out and about not wanting to kill my cellphone data with streaming, this feed is what I usually listen to.
