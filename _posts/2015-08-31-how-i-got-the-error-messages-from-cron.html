<p>So I needed to use Cron to run a script on regular intervals. I quickly realized that running code without error messages was no fun &amp; I needed to see what is going on.</p>
<p>There must have been a way to write it to a log but it seems like the way people usually handle error messages from Cron is via sending an email, so that's what I went for.</p>
<p>I followed this post &amp; got it working</p>

<p>Getting my error messages emailed to me helped me find my mistake &amp; now my script works.</p>
