title: Where to get started with coding or data science
---

I recently had a friend tell me they started with Python coding because they
wanted to start a career in Application Development or Data Science. They asked
for my thoughts on this approach. This post is my reply.

Let me start with my thoughts on Python. If you don't yet know what you want to
do with programming, I think it is an excellent choice. Python is used in many
different industries for many different things. Python was the first language I
learned and even though I never got paid to work in it, I was able to make a few
useful things for myself and it gave me a good foundation to later move to Ruby
and Javascript which I now get paid for.

One of the most difficult skills to develop while learning to code is learning
to take a problem the way a human understands it, and to break it down into
steps that a computer can follow. You will learn how to do this no matter what
programming language you choose.

It is easy to switch programming languages later. Because the actual language
doesn't have that many words or constructs.

It might be more important to find a local meetup with people who are excited
enough about whatever language you choose to meet during an evening or on the
weekend to discuss their craft. Finding the kind of people who would gladly help
a newbie are the kinds of people you eventually want to work with. Which is also
more important than what language you use.

So I would suggest you keep learning Python for now, and when you find either
something specific you want to build or a specific group of people you want to
geek out with, switch to whatever language is best for that.

If you are trying to choose between Application Development and Data Science.
Here are my thoughts, maybe they will help in your decision. Keep in mind, I
think data science is really really cool, but I have no experience with it
myself. I am a web developer.

### Application Developent

* You are telling a computer EXACTLY what to do. (Take what this user typed and
  save it there). If this sounds boring, it's not. The problem solving has an
  addictive nature. The hours in my day literally fly by when I code.
* Fairly interactive. Lots of people skills required to understand what people
  need you to build
* You do not need a degree for this. A degree might even be a waste of time and
  money. But if you have the freedom to pursue a degree anyways it would never
  hurt.
* You can freelance or work for a company. I have chosen to work for a company
  in my current season.
* It will take you less time to get to the point where you can get a job as an
  Application Developer than a Data Scientist.

### Data Science

* You don't know exactly what you want the computer to do you just have a goal
  in mind, like "Recommend songs the user would like", then you train the
  computer (kind of like training a dog) to look through data and learn how to
  do the right thing. Your thoughts might go like this: _"I do not know what
  song to recommend this user, but go look through what they liked in the past
  and find others who liked the same things, see if that gives you good guesses
  about what they like, also look at the tempo of the music they liked and try
  to predict what they will like from that. Then just choose whatever you (the
  computer) can see is giving you the most accurate guesses."_ In the end, you
  the data scientist, don't even know or care why the computer recommended once
  specific song, you just care about the math behind how it weighed different
  options and that it came up with a good suggestion.
* I don't know how interactive this is. I think you might work on the exact same
  well-defined problem looking for a solution for quite a while without needing
  to check in with people, which may or may not be ideal depending how
  extroverted you are.
* You will need to study advanced math, specifically, statistics to do this
  well.
* You probably need a degree for this.
* This will probably be working for a company, I have not heard of people
  freelancing as data scientists. Partly because practicing it takes time to
  really understand a very specific domain, like _"What is it about Music that
  makes people like it"_ or where I work, our data scientists are working on
  _"What is it about a sales email that cause people to hit reply"._
