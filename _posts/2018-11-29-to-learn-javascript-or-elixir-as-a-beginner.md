title: To learn JavaScript or Elixir as a beginner
---

As a beginner programmer, already having learned some JavaScript and considering
learning React to build on your JavaScript knowledge or switching to Elixir,
here is some information to help you decide.

The most powerful/amazing/heavy-duty/military-grade stack that anyone could
conceive in 2018, would probably be an Elixir back-end with a JavaScript/React
front-end. Facebook uses both technologies. They use React to build their
Front-end and Erlang (Which Elixir is built on) to build some of their back-end.
I am not making a job at Facebook the goal here, it's just that they are doing
what they do at a higher scale than anyone else, and we can learn something from
them.

## Some pro's for each:

### Javascript:

- Much more popular. More people who can teach you further or help you when you
  get stuck. More games and other fun resources for learning Javascript.
- If you don't know anyone that will help you with learning Elixir, you should
  probably choose Javascript just for that.
- Easier to find a job working for someone else, part time or full-time. Just
  google React Developer Jobs. There is a TON out there.
- Using React, it would take you less time to build something that you or
  someone else really would like to use. Some game, or a way to calculate
  something. This is because you could build a cool and useable front-end
  without worrying about a back-end.

### Elixir:

- It feels like space-age technology. The things it does well, it does WAY
  better than anything else.
- All other web servers I have ever seen, measure their response time in
  milliseconds that is Thousandths of a second, under 200ms is fine. Elixir web
  servers are the only ones I have ever seen that measure their response in
  microseconds, which is Millionths of a second. You probably don't need this,
  it's just crazy cool. It feels like the future.
- If you became good at Elixir, you would have a niche that less people have.
  (long term) If Elixir became very popular in the future (this is a risky bet)
  you would be able to help a lot of newcomers who needs to know this to get a
  job, or help a lot of companies, that used the technology because it is
  popular, but now need an expert to help them with it.
- You would need to spend more time with Elixir before being able to build
  anything useful, you would need to learn about the back-end and front-end and
  how the two interacts, but after you do, you would be able to build very
  interesting systems with multiple users interacting with each other.
- If you ever wanted to start your own business, building something on Elixir
  might be a better choice. There are too many flashy things that look cool to
  compete with as a lone programmer, you will not win by building a more flashy
  front-end, you would need to look for something useful that doesn't exist, and
  even if it is a bit ugly at first, people will use it because they need it.
