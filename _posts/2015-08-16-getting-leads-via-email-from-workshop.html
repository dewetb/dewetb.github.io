<p>Right now, running Together Technologies takes 100% of my working hours and at the end of the week, usually leaves me evaluating how I could have prioritized better because something that would have furthered the core mission of Together Tech still didn't get done.</p>
<p>But the next time I find myself with time that I want to turn into Dollars, I want to tryÂ http://letsworkshop.com/ to get leads.</p>
<p>I do not like that their pricing is not on their website but I'm guessing it is somewhere between $100 - $150 per month to get the daily emails.</p>
