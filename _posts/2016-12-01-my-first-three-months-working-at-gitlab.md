title: My First Three Months Working at GitLab
---

I have not blogged in a while, becuase three months ago I started working at
GitLab as a [Service Engineer](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/service-engineer/)
and have been focusing all my efforts on drinking from the firehose.

Check me out [here on the team page](https://about.gitlab.com/team/).

I am enjoying it, learning a ton. Getting to use my background in education to
teach others on the team and our clients how to do cool things with GitLab.

I especially enjoy how much Linux server administration I get to learn while
keeping our giant Rails app running on all the different server setups our
clients come up with.
