title: The sweetspot Toptal seems to fill

Here is my take on some different services for finding consulting clients, and why I am currently applying to get into Toptal.

Not bad. I have done some work on there and have dealt with some really friendly and thankful clients. But since anyone in the world can sign up right now and call themselves a developer and list their price as lower than yours, it's hard to charge good prices there. Also, because it is seen as "budget outsourcing", it is often used as such. Many of the clients on there are wanting software built that would be "nice to have", they don't see the software as an essential part of their business, if it was, they would be looking somewhere else where they would be taking less risk.

Cool service. There just wasn't enough Ruby jobs for me. At the time I was also looking for contracts and not for a full time position, and most of the Ruby postings were job postings, which I wasn't looking for at the time. I am more open to a full time position now so I will probably give this service a try again in the future.

This definitely has the potential of making more money. But personally, I'd rather make less money and outsource my marketing and brand recognition work. I know it might seem lazy but I would rather put that effort into becoming a better programmer, later down the road I can monetize on that by solving massively expensive and difficult problems that I am an expert at solving.

Toptal has already done a lot of the hard work for me as a developer, by building a brand that clients trust. They also do a lot of the hard work for the client, by having a rigorous interview process before a developer or designer can be listed on the site. Toptal seems to occupies a sweet spot for me here in that I get some of the benefits that would come from a trusted brand that I had to build myself, and some of the benefits of an outsourcing website where I can just go sign up and find clients. I am currently in the application process so I will let you know how it turns out and if it lives up to my expectations.
