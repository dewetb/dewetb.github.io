# Together Tech
Together Technologies was a technology skills and mentorship program that I
ran with my wife Marysol. It is no longer running, but to remember this sweet
season in our lives we keep the promo video alive here. After the video was
made we changed the tech skills to Ruby on Rails web development with the same
mentorship focus.
