<h1>Can I help you?</h1>

<p>
  If you have a problem that you think can be solved with a web application, scroll to the bottom & send me an email so we can set up a "No Strings Attached" Skype call to talk about it.

<h1>If I can help, here's what I'll do</h1>
<p>
  Let's find where your employees or customers are wasting their time or getting stuck. Then I will build you a web application that automates boring stuff, removes the friction & let them focus on what they are trying to get done. I specialize in Ruby, Rails and Linux.

    He worked exactly as specified, communicated clearly and executed fast. I'd definitely hire him again and probably will if this project goes to stage 2. I could not think of a better-skilled communicator who handles responsibility that well.

    Most investors will tell you to bet on the team then the idea, and a no-brainer if both. Together Tech, founded by the Blomerus', is that whole package. They combine big vision with hands-on leadership while modeling hard work and selfless love. Together Tech is poised to make a huge impact at the emerging intersection of technology innovation and social entrepreneurship. I'm amazed at what they've accomplised in such a short time, and I can't wait to see how many more families and communities will be touched through their legacy of Together Tech men.
