<h1>Can I help you?</h1>

<p>
If you have a problem that you think can be solved with a web application, <a href="mailto:dewet@blomerus.org?Subject=Hello%20De%20Wet,%20I%20was%20just%20on%20your%20hire-me%20page" target="_top">send me an email</a> so we can set up a "No Strings Attached" Skype call to talk about it.
</p>
<h1>If I can help, here's what I'll do</h1>
<p>
  Let's find where your employees or customers are wasting their time or getting stuck. Then I will build you a web application that automates boring stuff, removes the friction & let them focus on what they are trying to get done. I specialize in Ruby, Rails and Linux.
</p>

  <p>The other thing that I can't seem to ever get enough of, is teaching people to code. I am in awe of the human brain and how with the right attitude, grit & deliberate practice, things that seem impossibly difficult, can become second nature. A skill that can then lead someone with minimal formal education out of crushing poverty.</p>

  <p>I founded <a href="http://togethertech.org/" target="blank">Together Technologies</a> where I work full time as the director. We are a coding bootcamp with the focus of developing strong role models in underprivileged communities around Cape Town, South Africa and empowering them in sustainable employment.</p>

      He worked exactly as specified, communicated clearly and executed fast. I'd definitely hire him again and probably will if this project goes to stage 2. I could not think of a better-skilled communicator who handles responsibility that well.
