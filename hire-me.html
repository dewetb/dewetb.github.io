<h1>How can I help?</h1>

<p>
  Thanks for your interest.
</p>
<p>
  I would love to discuss what you have in mind. Feel free to <a href="mailto:dewet@blomerus.org?Subject=Hello%20De%20Wet,%20I%20was%20just%20on%20your%20hire-me%20page" target="_top">send me an email</a> if you are interested in working with me. (dewet@blomerus.org)
</p>
<p>
  I specialize in Ruby, Rails and Linux. More importantly understanding what companies and their clients need and then problem solving.

      He worked exactly as specified, communicated clearly and executed fast. I'd definitely hire him again and probably will if this project goes to stage 2. I could not think of a better-skilled communicator who handles responsibility that well.

      De Wet's honest and simple approach to problem solving was a breath of fresh air. The work was completed at a very high standard and best of all within timeframe and budget.
